                   a BSc (Hons) in Web and Multimedia Development. I am passionate about being creative and enjoy
                   exploring various artistic pursuits such as painting, drawing, and trying new things.

            <p>As a creative and entrepreneurial designer, I have turned my passion for macrame and crafts into a thriving business. 
               My journey began at the University where I was provided with a solid foundation
               in web design, branding, and graphic design using industry-standard tools such as Adobe Illustrator,
               Photoshop, and Canva. 
            </p><br>
    
            <p>In addition to my craft business, I have honed my abilities in web and multimedia development, learning
               to design visually appealing and user-friendly websites. My portfolio includes a range of macrame 
               projects that showcase my talent and creativity, from intricate wall hangings to delicate jewelry pieces.
               Each item is crafted with care and attention to detail, reflecting my dedication to quality and aesthetics.
            </p><br>
    
            <p>I am excited to continue growing my business and expanding my online presence by creating a dedicated 
               website for my macrame projects. The logo you see at the top left of the page is a testament to my 
               branding efforts and design expertise.
